        "Cryptocurrency: Should It Be Accepted Or Not? Widely seen as a disruption for the traditional banking and financial institutions, cryptocurrencies have gained significant traction over the last half a decade, at the same time creating a regulatory nightmare for banking regulators across the globe. | At present, there are around 969 cryptocurrencies in existence across the globe, with a total market capitalization close to 116 billion US$. A cryptocurrency is a digital currency created and stored electronically. Unlike monetary currency, the supply of cryptocurrency is not determined by any central bank or authority and the network is completely decentralised. | A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses cryptography to secure its transactions, to control the creation of additional units and to verify the transfer of assets. Cryptocurrencies are a type of digital currency, alternative currency and virtual currency. Cryptocurrencies use decentralised control as opposed to centralised electronic money and central banking systems. | The decentralised control of each cryptocurrency works through a block chain, which is a public transaction database functioning as a distributed ledger. The validity of each cryptocurrency’s coins is provided by block chain. A block chain is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. | It is transferred directly between peers and the transactions are confirmed in a public ledger, accessible to all the users. The process of maintaining this ledger and validating the transactions, better known as mining, is carried out in a decentralized manner. | The underlying principle of the authenticity of the present to historical transactions is cryptographic proof, instead of trust; different from how it happens in the case of traditional banking systems. The first decentralized cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, created in 2009. Since then numerous other cryptocurrencies have been created as already mentioned. Cryptocurrencies  are gaining popularity; they provide privacy protection, cost effectiveness, lower entry barriers; can be used as alternative to banking systems and fiat currencies, open source Methodology and  public participation and also immunity to government led financial retribution. | Every transaction is transparent, autonomous and secure. Due to these benefits, cryptocurrency started to gain acceptance worldwide. Despite these numerous advantages and user friendly processes, cryptocurrencies have their own set of associated risks in the form of volatility in valuation, lack of liquidity, security and many more. | Cryptocturrencies are being denounced in many countries because of their use in grey and black markets. There are two sets of interconnected risks: one being the growth and expansion of these platforms in the uncertain policy environment, and the other being the risks these platforms pose to the users and the security of the state. They also have the potential use for Illicit Trade and Criminal  Activities and can be used for Terror Financing. | They also have the potential for Tax Evasion. The acceptability of cryptocurrencies as a legal instrument currently varies from country to country; while some are in the process of formulating laws and measures, others are yet to respond to this disruptive change. The burgeoning use of cryptocurrencies in terror financing, ransom wares, illicit drugs or arms trade and cybercrime has also raised red flags among the security and law enforcement agencies. | They may well have the potential to displace the existing financial systems which enable electronic flow of money across different political boundaries. Slowly, cryptocurrencies are coming under the regulatory net in order to check misuse. Japan recently became the first country to regulate cryptocurrencies, the US is quickly laying down regulatory guidelines. | The UK and Australia continue to work on the formalities while China has recently banned Initial Coin Offerings due to various reasons, including various ICO scams around the world. | Though India plays a relatively small role in the global cryptocurrency market, with only about 2 % of the global cryptocurrency  market  cap.",

        "I became a magicians dream. I could disappear. Gone. I found comfort feeling invisible to the outside world. Maybe somewhere, \
        someone wondered where I was. Or maybe someone was looking for me. Or wanted to save me. I couldn’t save myself, that’s for sure. \
        I didn’t know who I was anymore, nor did I notice that I was slowly killing my soul and breaking my father’s heart. There was always \
        someone that could aid my escape. With a snap of my fingers or a text message, I was so far gone that no one could get me. I was \
        unstoppable. Out of control; out of my body. I was a new person killing all that remained of my spirit. Losing consciousness was such a \
        relief. Regaining it was not nearly as fun. My heavy head is being shaken by hands. They definitely aren’t mine. My mouth feels open. \
        The first thing my exhausted eyes find is his worried face. His brown eyes look like they are going to pop off and roll onto the \
        bathroom floor next to my sprawled-out body. He’s yelling at me. He’s not angry, but all he keeps repeating is my pitiful name, \
        I don’t want any of this. I shut my heavy eye-lids. I want anything but this. I want a new escape. I want a do-over. I want this game \
        to end. I don’t care if I win anymore. Being conscious is too much work. My fragile body lay slumped against the yellow wall. His hands \
        are pushing harder on my cheeks. Is he trying to save me? I don’t want to die like this, but I guess this literally isn’t in my hands \
        anymore. My cold fingers are suctioned to the linoleum. This floor is going to be the last thing I hold. I wish this wasn’t it. \
        “Open your fucking eyes, Marissa. Look at me.” His voice was so persuading. I’m still alive. I look at my savior in a red hoodie. \
        “Keep breathing,” he said, “in through your nose and out through your mouth.” “You need to do this. Listen to me, damnit.” I manage to \
        lift my skull and lean it back on the yellow wall. My mouth is mumbling. My tongue feels too big. It’s blocking my voice. I want to tell \
        him sorry; really really sorry. But those words can’t seem to fit around this massive thing in my mouth. I need to keep my eyes open and \
        breathe. This is too much. I can’t. My upcoming demise is all I can focus on. Why try so hard to stay alive if I am just going to die?\
        I’m drowning. The water is so cold on my chest. Now it’s covering my face. I wake up again. I’m still here on the bathroom floor in \
        Weymouth, Massachusetts. It’s the same place we did bumps of coke at so many times before. We used his Visa Check card and then \
        chain-smoke Newport’s. I would sit on the sink high as fuck, but now it’s so different. I wanted to be alive then, but now death seems \
        like paradise. He uses the same towel we always tucked under the door to wipe off my dripping face. I’m angry now. My makeup must be \
        smeared and my hair is soaked. I’m so ugly. I don’t want to die ugly.My thumbs are gone. They aren’t moving.  No matter how hard I try. \
        My body isn’t mine. Somebody else has the remote control. I can’t move my limbs or remember how to breathe. This must be how it feels \
        to be paralyzed. “I can’t,” I whimper. I watch him throw little plastic baggies in the toilet. The home telephone is in his left hand \
        and he’s holding it up high. “If you pass out again, I’m getting an ambulance. Fucking breathe, Marissa.” Can’t he just let me be? \
        Can’t he let me die in peace? The toilet flushes as my eyes shut."
